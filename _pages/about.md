Hi! I'm a postdoctoral researcher with the [Chang Lab](https://changlab.ucsf.edu) in the Department of Neurological Surgery at the University of California, San Francisco. Prior to joining the Chang Lab, I conducted my doctoral research at the [Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics](https://www.mpi.nl) under the supervision of Prof. Antje Meyer and Prof. James M. McQueen in the [Psychology of Language Department](https://www.mpi.nl/department/psychology-language/5). 

My areas of specialization include phonetics, psycholinguistics, speech neuroscience, and (non-invasive) vagus nerve stimulation. Working with Dr. Matthew K. Leonard at UCSF, my current [research](/research/) focuses on the development and validation of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation as a technique for modulating brain activity and neural plasticity related to auditory and psycholinguistic processes involved in second language acquisition. In collaboration with researchers from multiple disciplines, I've [published](/publications/) research in journals such as _the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences_, _npj Science of Learning_, _Language_, _The Journal of Sociolinguistics_, and _The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America_.
